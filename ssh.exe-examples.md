##### Login With Password:
1. Work Group Users:
     * `ssh user@host`
2. Domain Users: Domain needs to be explicitly specified. Any of the following formats would work:
     * `ssh -l user@domain host`
     * `ssh domain\user@host`
     * `ssh user@domain@host`


##### Login With SSH Keys
**Setup Server machine**
***
1. Copy `id_rsa.pub` (client's public key) to corresponding user's directory on ssh server machine
     * as `%systemdrive%\users\<user>\.ssh\authorized_keys` (path on the ssh server machine)
2. Make sure the authorized_keys file is [secured][Secure file] and "NT Service\sshd" has Read access to it
```   
   $authorizedKeyPath = "%systemdrive%\users\<user>\.ssh\authorized_keys"
   $acl = get-acl $authorizedKeyPath
   $ar = New-Object  System.Security.AccessControl.FileSystemAccessRule("NT Service\sshd", "Read", "Allow")
   $acl.SetAccessRule($ar)
   Set-Acl  $authorizedKeyPath $acl
``` 

**Usage from Client machine**
***

1. Generate a key pair on the client:
     * `ssh-keygen -t rsa -f id_rsa`
     * if existing key pair generated by ssh-keygen.exe before build [v0.0.13.0][build13] are used, make sure they are [secured][Secure file].
2. Register [secured][Secure file] private key with ssh-agent (for single sign-on experience)
     * `net start ssh-agent`
     * `ssh-add id_rsa` 
3. Login using [secured][Secure file] private key.
     * `ssh -i .\id_rsa user@host` (work group user)
     * `ssh -i .\id_rsa -l user@domain host` (domain user)
