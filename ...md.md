Intro
-----
[OpenSSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSSH), part of OpenBSD operating system, is a bunch of utility programs based on [SSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell) protocol. These include server and client executables as well as utilities to create and manage cryptographic keys. [Portable OpenSSH](http://www.openssh.com/portable.html) is derived from the OpenBSD project and ported to support a wide variety of Unix flavors. The goal of this project is to extend support to Windows family of operating systems and be able to do this in a common repository without needing a Windows specific fork. 

Relevant design details in the context of this project -     
OpenSSH and the portable version are single threaded applications, interacting with IO using POSIX based [File Descriptors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_descriptor) and multiplexing IO operations using [select] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_%28Unix%29) calls. Session isolation and [privilege separation](http://www.citi.umich.edu/u/provos/ssh/privsep.html) are implemented using the standard UNIX routines - [fork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(system_call)), [setuid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setuid), [chroot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroot) routines. IPC is carried over [UNIX domain sockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_domain_socket). 


Goals
-----
As stated earlier, the main goal is side by side Windows support in the portable version of OpenSSH. The project is currently being worked on a fork of OpenSSH7.1p1 - here after, called win32-fork code and main code respectively. The plan is get this fork to a state that could integrate into the latest version in main, sometime around May-June this year, with minimum impact to main sources. Obviously, we would want to reuse the main code as much as possible, whilst respecting the fundamental differences between Unix and Windows operating systems. 

Guidelines
-----------
To prevent any regressions in main and to enable easier review of the changes coming from win32-fork, there will be no "main" code moving or refactoring. There are multiple places where platform abstraction makes sense (auth, console to name a few), but this wont be addressed in the fork as it would lead to significant code churn. This will be done post integration once we have stable Windows supported version with significant test coverage living in main repo. Crypto support using Windows [CNG](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa376210(v=vs.85).aspx) has been tested out in fork but will its changes will be reverted\undone as it needed reasonable modifications to "main" code. This means that the Windows supported version potentially available mid this year will rely on OpenSSL's crypto (exception is SSP for key-based authentication that will use CNG - more details later).

Design details
-------------
### Transport Layer - POSIX IO
This layer of protocol implementation in OpenSSH consists of mainly IO, parsing and crypto code. The aim it keep this layer mostly common between Windows and Unix by implementing a POSIX IO wrapper on top of Win32 async File IO (parsing is common for both, crypto will remain common for this milestone). This wrapper strictly implements the POSIX IO needs of OpenSSH keeping the code differences in transport layer to a minimum. Note that the wrapper implements only the calls needed by OpenSSH (and not all defined in POSIX standard). Specifically, the wrapper implements
+ IO calls creating file descriptors - open, creat, socket, accept, socketpair, pipe
+ operations on a single file descriptor - fd_set, FD_* macros, read, write, recv, send, fstat, fdopen, close, dup and dup2
+ operations on multiple file descriptors - select
+ signal semantics on these operations - ex. select (or any blocking IO call) returning EINTR
+ SIGABRT, SIGTERM, SIGCHLD, SIGINT, SIGPIPE and SIGALRM

Brief design details of POSIX wrapper
+ Single threaded (not thread safe based on current needs but can be made so if needed going forward). 
+ Maintains file descriptor table and its state. Table stores mapping between file descriptors (int) and associated Windows IO state (handle, buffers, async call state, etc). 
+ fd_set implemented as a bit array, lowest available file descriptors get allocated first.
+ Calls underlying Win32 APIs that provide [Overlapped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlapped_I/O) semantics. 
+ "select" and blocking IO calls go through a common "wait_for_any" function that wakes up on
  - IO completions
  - Signals
  - Timers
+ All underlying Win32 IO API calls are made asynchronous (non-blocking). Blocking semantics are implemented within the wrapper by an explicit "wait_for_any" for IO to complete.
+ Uses [APCs](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms681951(v=vs.85).aspx) wherever available and minimzing use of [events](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms682655(v=vs.85).aspx). This simplifies code and has performance benefits.
+ Maintains internal buffers to accommodate an underlying fundamental difference between POSIX and Win32 IO APIs - IOReady Vs IOComplete (Ex for a Read operation, POSIX APIs signal when IO is ready - date will be subsequently, explicitly read, Win32 APIs signal when IO has completed - data is already copied to a user provided buffer. Though this may be perceived as a performance hit, a validation exercise did not show any major impact. It in fact proved beneficial in reducing kernel calls during "read"s (ex. reading a header, would fetch the entire packet in a single call). 
+ Additional details on underlying Win32 calls used

| POSIX IO call  |  Underlying Win32 IO call(s) | Additional details |
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| accept | AcceptEx | No APC semantics so, explicit event used for async IO   |
| connect | ConnectEx | No APC semantics so, explicit event used for async IO |
| send | WSASend |  |
| recv | WSARecv |   |
| open | CreateFile |   |
| creat | CreateFile |  |
| pipe | CreateNamedPipe  | A uni directional named pipe with and internal name is created, CreateFile called to connect from other end  |
| read | ReadFileEx |   |
| write | WriteFileEx |   |
| fdopen | TBD |    |
| fstat |  TBD |     |
| dup, dup2 | SetStdHandle | only supported on standard IO file descriptors (used for IO redirection) |
| socketpair | CreateNamedPipe | A bi directional named pipe with an internal name is created, CreateFile called to connect from other end. This does not support AF_UNIX ancilliary messages. More details later |

A fully functional prototype (for socket, file and pipe IO) of this wrapper is available [here](https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH/tree/L2-Win32Posix-Prototype/contrib/win32/w32-posix-prototype/win32posix.)

#### AF_UNIX domain sockets
Unix domain sockets are used for IPC communication between processes on the same host. Apart from providing stream/datagram modes, they also support a secure way to transmit ancillary data (like file descriptors). The only place ancillary data is used in OpenSSH is in "ProxyUseFDPass" feature where a proxy command is issued by ssh client to create a connected socket, and its FD is transmitted back over IPC. This feature will be disabled on Windows. The rest of the places AF_UNIX sockets are used:
+ ControlMaster - used to multiplex multiple sessions over a single SSH connection. A secure Windows pipe can be used for this purpose.
+ SSHAgent - used to managed store keys and crypto validation based on those. Current plan is to replace its client side usage with Windows Credential manager. Server side plan is TBD. 
+ Local Socket Forwarding - This is forwarding traffic to AF_UNIX sockets and this feature is not applicable in Windows
+ SSHD rexec - TBD
+ SSHD from inetd - TBD
