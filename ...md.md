Intro
-----
[OpenSSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSSH), part of OpenBSD operating system, is a bunch of utility programs based on [SSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell) protocol. These include server and client executables as well as utilities to create and manage cryptographic keys. [Portable OpenSSH](http://www.openssh.com/portable.html) is derived from the OpenBSD project and ported to support a wide variety of Unix flavors. The goal of this project is to extend support to Windows family of operating systems and be able to do this in a common repository without needing a Windows specific fork. 

Relevant design details in the context of this project -     
OpenSSH and the portable version are single threaded applications, interacting with IO using POSIX based [File Descriptors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_descriptor) and multiplexing IO operations using [select] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_%28Unix%29) calls. Session isolation and [privilege separation](http://www.citi.umich.edu/u/provos/ssh/privsep.html) are implemented using the standard UNIX routines - [fork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(system_call)), [setuid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setuid), [chroot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroot) routines. IPC is carried over [UNIX domain sockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_domain_socket). 


Goals
-----
As stated earlier, the main goal is side by side Windows support in the portable version of OpenSSH. The project is currently being worked on a fork of OpenSSH7.1p1 - here after, called win32-fork code and main code respectively. The plan is get this fork to a state that could integrate into the latest version in main, sometime around May-June this year, with minimum impact to main sources. Obviously, we would want to reuse the main code as much as possible, whilst respecting the fundamental differences between Unix and Windows operating systems. 

Guidelines
-----------
To prevent any regressions in main and to enable easier review of the changes coming from win32-fork, there will be no "main" code moving or refactoring. There are multiple places where platform abstraction makes sense (auth, console to name a few), but this wont be addressed in the fork as it would lead to significant code churn. This will be done post integration once we have stable Windows supported version with significant test coverage living in main repo. Crypto support using Windows [CNG](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa376210(v=vs.85).aspx) has been tested out in fork but will be undone as it needed reasonable changes to "main" code. This means that the Windows supported version potentially available mid this year will rely on OpenSSL's crypto (exception is SSP for key-based authentication that will use CNG - more details later).
