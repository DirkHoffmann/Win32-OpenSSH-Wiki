See [Logging Facilities](https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH/wiki/Logging-Facilities) to modify logging location.

Troubleshooting steps for typical service startup and connection issues:

* If you see connection getting reset right after sending SSH2_MSG_KEXINIT, see if [this](https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH/issues/1027) may help. 

* Server side: run `sshd` in debug mode
  * `Stop-Service sshd` (if sshd service is running)
  * `sshd.exe -d` This will run sshd in interactive mode under currently logged on user (typically as admin). Note that, in this mode, you can only login as the "currently logged on user" and only using "key based auth". To overcome these restrictions, you should instead run `psexec -s sshd.exe -d` to run sshd as SYSTEM.
  * This will dump debug logs in real time to stdout on the console
  * You can also add additional `d`s for more detailed loggin:
    * `sshd.exe -dd` or `sshd.exe -ddd`
* Client side: start `ssh` in verbose mode
  * `ssh.exe -v ...`
  * This will dump verbose logs in real time to stdout on the console
  * You can also add additional `v`s to get more verbose messages:
    * `ssh.exe -vv ...` or `ssh.exe -vvv`

Troubleshooting more complex issues:
* Server side
  * Stop `sshd`
    * `Stop-Service sshd`
  * Delete `sshd.log` and `ssh-agent.log` (under %programdata%\ssh\logs)
  * Set the following in `sshd_config`
    * `SyslogFacility LOCAL0`
    * `LogLevel` to `DEBUG` (or `DEBUG2`/`DEBUG3` for higher levels of logging)
  * Rerun the workflow that's giving you problems. `logs\sshd.log` will contain `sshd` related traces.
  * If the problem isn't clear, please post these logs along with some steps to help us reproduce your problem in [our GitHub Issues](https://github.com/powershell/Win32-OpenSSH/issues).
* Client side
  * Set `LogLevel` to `DEBUG` (or `DEBUG2`/`DEBUG3` for higher levels of logging) in `ssh_config`. 
  * Run `ssh.exe` in verbose mode as detailed above
