Powershell utility scripts are included starting release [v0.0.15.0](https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH/releases/tag/v0.0.15.0) to automatically fix the permissions on various keys and configuration files for host and user. [Secure protection of various files](https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH/wiki/Security-protection-of-various-files-in-Win32-OpenSSH) explains why secure enforcement is needed.

**`FixHostFilePermissions.ps1`**

It checks and fixes the below permissions on default host files:
 - user's authorized_keys located at `$env:systemdrive\Users\...\.ssh\authorized_keys`
 - host keys generated by `ssh-keygen.exe -A` in the same folder of the script
 - sshd_config in the same folder of the script

```PowerShell
# script prompt to confirm you want to update each permission if Quiet is not specified
.\FixHostFilePermissions.ps1
```

**`FixUserFilePermissions.ps1`**

It checks and fixes the below file permissions on user's default files: 
 - user's ssh_config located at `~\.ssh\config`
 - user's keys located at `~\.ssh\id_rsa`, `~\.ssh\id_rsa.pub`
 - user's keys located at `~\.ssh\id_dsa`, `~\.ssh\id_dsa.pub`

```PowerShell
# -Quiet suppresses prompting to confirm you want to update each permission
.\FixUserFilePermissions.ps1 -Quiet 
```

**`OpenSSHUtils.psm1` module**

It checks and fixes permissions on customer specified files.
 - Function `Fix-HostSSHDConfigPermissions` fixes permission on sshd_config file specified by user
 - Function `Fix-HostKeyPermissions` fixes permission for host keys specified by user; **Note that to keep the host private keys secure, it is recommended to register them with ssh-agent following
steps in [link](https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH/wiki/Install-Win32-OpenSSH)**, but this function suggests to grant 'NT Service\sshd' Read permission to the host keys. Choose no if they are registered already.
 - Function `Fix-UserKeyPermissions` fixes the permissions on user's key files specified by user
 - Function `Fix-AuthorizedKeyPermissions` fixes permissions on the authorized_keys file specified by user
 - Function `Fix-UserSSHConfigPermissions` fixes permissions on user's ssh config specified by user

```PowerShell
Import-Module .\OpenSSHUtils.psm1 -Force
# prompt to confirm you want to confirm you want to update each permission on the file
Fix-HostSSHDConfigPermissions c:\test\sshd_config
# -Quiet suppresses prompting to confirm you want to update each permission on the file
Fix-AuthorizedKeyPermissions -FilePath C:\Users\sshtest_ssouser\.ssh\authorized_keys -Quiet
Fix-HostKeyPermissions -FilePath c:\test\sshtest_hostkey_ecdsa -Quiet
Fix-HostUserPermissions -FilePath c:\test\sshtest_userssokey_ed25519 -Quiet
Fix-UserSSHConfigPermissions -FilePath '~\.ssh\config' -Quiet
```
