Powershell utility scripts are included starting release [V0.0.15.0](https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH/releases/tag/v0.0.15.0) to automatically fix the permissions on various keys and configuration files for host and user. [Secure protection of various files](https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH/wiki/Security-protection-of-various-files-in-Win32-OpenSSH) explains why secure enforcement is needed.
  - `FixHostFilePermissions.ps1`: checks and fixes the below permissions on default host files:
     - user's authorized_keys located at `$env:systemdrive\Users\...\.ssh\authorized_keys`

     - sshd_config in the same folder of the script

```PowerShell
# script prompt to confirm you want to update each permission if Quiet is not specified
.\FixHostFilePermissions.ps1
```
  - `FixUserFilePermissions.ps1`: checks and fixes the below file permissions for user's default files: 
     - user's ssh_config located at `~\.ssh\config`
     - user's keys located at `~\.ssh\id_rsa`, `~\.ssh\id_rsa.pub`
     - user's keys located at `~\.ssh\id_dsa`, `~\.ssh\id_dsa.pub`

```PowerShell
# -Quiet suppresses prompting to confirm you want to update each permission
.\FixUserFilePermissions.ps1 -Quiet 
```
