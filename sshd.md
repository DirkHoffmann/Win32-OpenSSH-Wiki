Listed here are Windows specific details that supplement or override the original sshd manual documented in [OpenBSD manual](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd). 

In Windows, sshd service can run under SYSTEM as service or run in interactive mode (typically as admin). 
* Please see "Server side: run sshd in debug mode" at [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH/wiki/Troubleshooting-Steps) to run in interactive mode
