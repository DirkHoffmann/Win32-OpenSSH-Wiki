# Secure protection of keys and configure files

Starting with the release of [v0.0.13.0][build13], Win32-OpenSSH ensures files are secure before they are loaded.
`ssh-keygen.exe` generates protected key files as well.

The following files need to be "secure":

- on the client-side
  - user's private keys
  - user's `ssh_config` located at `~\.ssh\config`
- on the server-side
  - user's `authorized_keys`
  - private host keys

"Secure" means:

1. The file owner of these files must be one of the following (additionally, no other users or groups may have any access to the files):
    - the local Administrators group
    - LocalSystem account
    - a user in the local Administrators group
    - the user associated with a user key or user config
1. `NT Service\sshd` must have (and only have) Read access to `authorized_keys` and all host keys.
(Note: this means that `NT Service\sshd` *cannot* have Write access or Full Control.)

## Utility scripts to adjust file permissions

The following scripts are used in instructions below to help with managing the permissions of key files:

### Set-SecureFileACL

`Set-SecureFileACL` removes inherited ACLs on a file, assigns the current user as an owner (unless the `-Owner` parameter is specified), and grants the owner Full Control of the file:

```powershell
function Set-SecureFileACL
{
    param(
        [string]$FilePath,
        [System.Security.Principal.NTAccount]$Owner = $null
        )

    $myACL = Get-ACL -Path $FilePath
    $myACL.SetAccessRuleProtection($True, $True)
    Set-Acl -Path $FilePath -AclObject $myACL

    $myACL = Get-ACL $FilePath
    $actualOwner = $null
    if($owner -eq $null)
    {
        $actualOwner = New-Object System.Security.Principal.NTAccount($($env:USERDOMAIN), $($env:USERNAME))
    }
    else
    {
        $actualOwner = $Owner
    }

    $myACL.SetOwner($actualOwner)

    if($myACL.Access)
    {
        $myACL.Access | % {
            if(-not ($myACL.RemoveAccessRule($_)))
            {
                throw "failed to remove access of $($_.IdentityReference.Value) rule in setup "
            }
        }
    }

    $objACE = New-Object System.Security.AccessControl.FileSystemAccessRule `
        ($actualOwner, "FullControl", "None", "None", "Allow")
    $myACL.AddAccessRule($objACE)
    Set-Acl -Path $FilePath -AclObject $myACL
}
```

#### Example: Setting the owner of `authorized_keys`

```powershell
$user = "<myusername>"
$objUser = New-Object System.Security.Principal.NTAccount($user)
Set-SecureFileACL -filepath $env:systemdrive\Users\$user\.ssh\authorized_keys -owner $objUser
```

### Add-PermissionToFileACL

`Add-PermissionToFileACL` grants an user a file permission to access a file.

```powershell
function Add-PermissionToFileACL
{
    param(
        [string]$FilePath,
        [System.Security.Principal.NTAccount] $User,
        [System.Security.AccessControl.FileSystemRights]$Perm)

    $myACL = Get-ACL $filePath
    $objACE = New-Object System.Security.AccessControl.FileSystemAccessRule `
        ($User, $perm, "None", "None", "Allow")
    $myACL.AddAccessRule($objACE)
    Set-Acl -Path $filePath -AclObject $myACL
}
```

#### Example: Grants `NT Service\sshd` Read permission to a host public key file

```powershell
Add-PermissionToFileACL -FilePath "$hostKeyFilePath -User "NT Service\sshd" -Perm "Read"
```

## Managing keys and config files end-to-end for Win32-OpenSSH

### Generating new keys using `v0.0.13.0`

If you've generated your host or user keys with `ssh-keygen.exe` after build [v0.0.13.0][build13], the user you've used to generated them will be the owner and have Full Control access.
However, some files will still require some ACL modification.

1. If the generated keys (both private and public) are going to be used as host keys, you must grant `NT Service\sshd` Read access: 
```powershell
Add-PermissionToFileACL -FilePath $hostKeyFilePath -User "NT Service\sshd" -Perm "Read"
Add-PermissionToFileACL -FilePath "$hostKeyFilePath.pub" -User "NT Service\sshd" -Perm "Read"
```

2. On the server running `sshd`, grant `NT Service\sshd` Read access to `authorized_keys` in `~\.ssh\`:
```powershell
$user = '<myusername>'
$userProfilePath = "$env:systemdrive\Users\$user"
Add-PermissionToFileACL -FilePath "$userProfilePath\.ssh\authorized_keys" -User "NT Service\sshd" -Perm "Read"
```

3. On the client machine, if an user has a `ssh_config` at `~\.ssh\config`, make sure that the user is the owner and has Full Control:
```powershell
Set-SecureFileACL '~\.ssh\config'
```

### Transitioning existing keys and files to `v0.0.13.0`

If you have host or user keys that were generated before build [v0.0.13.0][build13], you'll need to secure those key files before using them `v0.0.13.0` or later.

The keys generated by `ssh-keygen.exe` before [v0.0.13.0][build13] inherit permissions from the parent folder.
That means that some disallowed accounts may also have access to the file.

1. On the server running `sshd`, change the file permission of the private host key to set the current user as owner and grant current user Full Control and `NT Service\sshd` Read access. 
```powershell
Set-SecureFileACL -FilePath $hostPrivateKeyFilePath
Add-PermissionToFileACL -FilePath $hostPrivateKeyFilePath -User "NT Service\sshd" -Perm "Read"
```

2. On the server running `sshd`, grant `NT Service\sshd` Read access to the public host key:
```powershell
Add-PermissionToFileACL -FilePath $hostPublicKeyFilePath -User "NT Service\sshd" -Perm "Read"
```

3. Before using a user key file with `ssh-add`, `scp`, `ssh`, or `sftp`, make sure that the file is owned by the user, and that the user has Full Control.
```powershell
Set-SecureFileACL -FilePath $userPrivateKeyFilePath
```

4. On the server running `sshd`, change the file permission of `authorized_keys` in a user's home directory to set the current user as owner and grant the current user Full Control and `NT Server\sshd` Read access.
```powershell
$user = '<myusername>'
$userProfilePath = "$env:systemdrive\Users\<user>"
$objUser = New-Object System.Security.Principal.NTAccount($user)
Set-SecureFileACL "$userProfilePath\.ssh\authorized_keys" -owner $objUser
Add-PermissionToFileACL -FilePath "$userProfilePath\.ssh\authorized_keys" -User "NT Service\sshd" -Perm "Read"
```

5. On the client, if a user has their own `ssh_config` located at `~\.ssh\config`, make sure that the user is the owner and has Full Control:
```powershell
Set-SecureFileACL "~\.ssh\config"
```
